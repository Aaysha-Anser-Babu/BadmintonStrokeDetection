# BadmintonStrokeDetection

Created a dataframe from accelorometer data (3 axis), gyrometer data(3 axis), magnetometer data(3 axis), yaw,pitch, roll. Calculated the energy and identified peaks in energy to define stroke interval. From the peaks split data set into stroke intervals. For now only Forehand lift can be identified but other strokes can be identified as not forehand lift.
